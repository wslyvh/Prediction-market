# Prediction-market

The project will start as a database whereby:

* as an administrator, you can add a yes/no question.
* as a regular user you can bet on an outcome of the question.
* as a trusted source, you can resolve the question.
* as a regular user, you can trigger the mutual-based payouts.

Eventually, you will refactor it to include:

* access to oracles.
* market-making.
